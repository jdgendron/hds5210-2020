# Midterm Feedback

## Overall Score: 
49 / 50




## Part 1: Creating a JSON Rules File
Comments - Nice work.  The only potential issue I see is with the FiO2 range being a text string rather than a range of values.  You'll be able to see how I did that in my walkthrough.  (-1)

## Part 2: Functions to evaluate rules
Comments - I like your generic get_points function!  As I expected, there's the <50 on FiO2.  It would have been best to use actual value ranges on this.  No more points off, though.  Nice work with your test cases.

## Part 3: Put it all together
Comments - Nice work putting it all together!

## Part 4: Accessing and processing the patient file
Comments - Nice work!  There are a few falses, but there were some nuances in < or <= on a couple of things, so I'm not taking off points for any mismatches.
